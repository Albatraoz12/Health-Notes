# Health Notes

Hello! I'm Dimosthenis Emmanouil, a full-stack web developer from Sweden.

**Health Notes** is a personal project designed to help me track my daily reflections and emotions. By recording my thoughts and moods each day, I aim to create a meaningful record of my emotional well-being over time.

## Features

- **Daily Journal**: A space to jot down thoughts and feelings each day, providing a safe and private area to reflect.
- **Mood Tracker**: Options to select and describe your mood, which are then visualized on a graph, allowing you to spot patterns and trends.
- **Progress Insights**: The graph display offers an overview of emotional changes over time, helping you understand yourself better.

## Purpose

Health Notes is created as a personal tool to monitor my well-being. Over time, the appâ€™s visual insights should allow me to see patterns in my mood and possibly identify factors that influence how I feel. This can be used as a self-reflection tool or shared with a mental health professional.
